Chat GPT voice assistant

All of you know that AI is getting a lot bigger and famous in the world. Chat gpt, one of the Most powerfull LLM (Large Language Model), created by
co-developer Mr. Sam altman, is the most famous AI model in the world.

So in this repository, I am making a chat gpt based voice assistant with python.
first of all, we need a chat gpt openai api. To get it follow these steps->

step1 -> Go to this link https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

step2 -> Click on 'create new secret key'

'Create new secret key' box will appear

Step3 -> Name the key, in my case, its 'chatgpt-python' and click on 'Create secret key' button.

Now some captcha will appear, after solving it, your key will be visible in the box. Save it in a memorable file because it will be used in the code.

To import the api in the code, open the chat-with-gpt or chat_with_gpt_wakeword code as your choice. Now, you will find a line of code named 'YOUR API'

finally, run the code and voila!, your own voice assistant
in the chat_with_gpt_wakeword code, you can say 'hey leo' to wake it up.

Or if you want to ask the time, you can just simply say 'what is the time'. No need of saying the wakeword.

Or if you want to exit, you can just simply say 'exit'. No need of saying the wakeword.

note -> these two functions and the wake word is not in the chat-with-gpt code.
